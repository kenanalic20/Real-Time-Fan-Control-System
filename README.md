## Introduction

This project implements a real-time system to control a fan based on the gas concentration measured by an MQ135 sensor. The system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller for processing and fan control.

## Features

- Real-time gas concentration monitoring.
- Automatic fan control based on a configurable gas concentration threshold.
- Non-blocking fan spin duration for improved responsiveness.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 development board.
- MQ135 gas sensor.
- DC fan (5V).
- Power supply.
- Connecting wires, breadboard, resistors, etc.

## Setup

1. **Connect Hardware:**
   - Connect the ESP32, MQ135 sensor, and the fan according to the hardware setup guidelines.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that the required libraries for the ESP32 and MQ135 sensor are installed in your Arduino IDE.

3. **Upload Code:**
   - Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your ESP32.

## Usage

- Power up the system.
- The fan will automatically turn on when the gas concentration exceeds the predefined threshold.
- The fan will turn off after the specified fan spin duration, even if the gas concentration remains high.

## Customization

- Adjust the gas concentration threshold and fan spin duration in the Arduino sketch based on your requirements.

## Troubleshooting

- **Fan Not Turning On:**
  - Check the gas sensor readings using the Serial Monitor to ensure it detects gas above the threshold.
  - Verify the connections between the ESP32, MQ135, and the fan.
